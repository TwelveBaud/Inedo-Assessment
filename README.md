During their hiring process, [Inedo](https://www.inedo.com/) often encounters prospects that have not demonstrated a 
sufficient level of competence according to their r&eacute;sum&eacute;s. Instead of discarding their applications
outright, Inedo offers candidates a second-chance challenge. If candidates succeed, it shows that they have the
technical background required even though it wasn't clear from their other documentation. If they fail, candidates
discover for themselves exactly what Inedo didn't believe they possessed, allowing them the ability to improve
and potentially get the job they desired in the future.

Inedo also runs the popular online community [The Daily WTF](https://thedailywtf.com/), as well as their 
[forums](https://what.thedailywtf.com). After a discussion regarding their company's policies and practices, and
following in the footsteps of another forum member's 
[fruit-sorting fiascos](https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/20934/testing-candidate-s-mettle-s02e01),
Inedo's founder, Alex Papadimoulis opened one of his recent assessments 
[to the forum](https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/27471/tech-asm-ls1-the-guru-s-blindspot)
(privileged account required). The story problem of the assessment was to exfiltrate data from a contracted
third-party's data warehouse using the provided API before the third party realized the contract was in jeopardy.

This is my entry for that assessment. **I am not currently applying for an Inedo position, but participating
in the spirit of competition. This represents my own work, and is not representative of Inedo or Interface Media
Group.**
